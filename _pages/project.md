</p>
Three types of Distributed MPC architectures were formulated for the leader-follower formation control of multiple MAVs and compared in a MATLAB simulator. According to the performance on formation control. robustness to communication quality and computational time, the best type was selected and compared with a Decentralized MPC controller in a Webots-ROS simulator.

We programed based on Crazyflie 2.1 to find and precisely land on a platform with height of 10 cm by utilizing z reading from flow deck. Additionally, We also utilized sensor readings from multi-ranger deck to avoid the obstacles presented in the environment.
