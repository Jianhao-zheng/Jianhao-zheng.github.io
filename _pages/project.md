# Semester project
## [Distributed Model Predictive Control Architectures for Multi-Rotor Micro Aerial Vehicles](/sp1/)

</p>
Three types of Distributed MPC architectures were formulated for the leader-follower formation control of multiple MAVs and compared in a MATLAB simulator. According to the performance on formation control. robustness to communication quality and computational time, the best type was selected and compared with a Decentralized MPC controller in a Webots-ROS simulator.
Code has not been open-source yet.

Mini project for [Vision Algorithms for Mobile Robots](http://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/teaching.html) given by [Prof. Davide Scaramuzza](http://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/people_scaramuzza.html), 2021.

My teammate Yujie has built [a nice web](https://yujie-he.github.io/project/2022-visual-odometry/) summarizing the project.

We programed based on Crazyflie 2.1 to find and precisely land on a platform with height of 10 cm by utilizing z reading from flow deck. Additionally, We also utilized sensor readings from multi-ranger deck to avoid the obstacles presented in the environment.
