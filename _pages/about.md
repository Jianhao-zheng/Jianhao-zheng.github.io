Welcome to my personal website!

I am a second-year master's student in [Robotics](https://www.epfl.ch/education/master/programs/robotics/) at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), Switzerland. Since Feb 2021, I have been working on [Multiple Micro Aerial Vehicles formation control](/sp1) supervised by [Izzet Kagan Erunsal](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/disal/people/team/kaganerunsal/) and [Prof. Alcherio Martinoli](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/disal/people/team/alcheriomartinoli/) at the [DISAL](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/disal/) lab. In last semester (21 Fall), I took part in the project on visual navigation algorithm at [TOPO](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/topo/) lab, supervised by [Dr. Iordan Doytchinov](https://people.epfl.ch/iordan.doytchinov) and [Prof. Bertrand Merminod](https://people.epfl.ch/bertrand.merminod?lang=en). I am working on adopting the Domain Decluttering techniques to close the synthetic-real doamin gap.

I received my Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering in 2020 from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), Shanghai, China. During that period, I worked on Cross-Modal Fusion or Biomolecular Structure Determination with [Prof. Gregory Chirikjian](https://me.jhu.edu/faculty/gregory-s-chirikjian/) at [NUS](https://www.nus.edu.sg/) and UR robot control with [Prof. Zhuang Fu](https://me.sjtu.edu.cn/en/FullTimeTeacher/fuzhuang.html) at SJTU.

My current research interests are Model Predictive Control, Aerial Robotics and SLAM. For more info, please refer to the latest [CV](../files/cv.pdf).
